This repository demonstrates a common error in decentralized applications (DApps) involving asynchronous operations. The `calculateTotalBug.js` file shows a function that correctly calculates the total price of items when data is available synchronously. However, in real-world DApps, data is often fetched asynchronously, leading to potential errors if not handled correctly.  `calculateTotalSolution.js` illustrates the correct way to handle such situations using Promises or async/await.
